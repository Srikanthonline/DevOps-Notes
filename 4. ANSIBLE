DEOPLYMENT

ANSIBLE:
its a free and open-source tool.
its an it engine that automates from server creation to deployment.
It is also called a configuration management tool.

configuration: cpu, memory and os
management: update, delete, install ----

ansible invented by Maichel dehaan in 2012.
ansible is taken by RedHat
We have both free and paid versions of ansible.
it is platform independent.
ansible works with YAML language.
ansible dependency is Python.
GUI for ansible is Ansible-Tower.

HOW IT WORKS ?
ARCHITECTURE:

ANSIBLE SERVER: used to communicate with worker nodes and install pkgs, deployment
WORKER NODES: takes commands from ansible server and works according to it
PLAYBOOK: conatins the code which is used to perform action.
INVENTORY: conatains info about worker nodes and group.



SETUP:
CREATE 5 SERVERS (1=ANSIBLE, 2=DEV, 2=TEST)
ALL SERVERS:
sudo -i
hostnamectl set-hostname ansible/dev-1/dev-2/test-1/test-2
sudo -i


passwd root
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config  (38 uncomment, 63 no=yes)
systemctl restart sshd
systemctl status sshd


ANSIBLE SERVER:
amazon-linux-extras install ansible2 -y
yum install python python-pip python-dlevel -y
vim /etc/ansible/hosts (12)

ssh-keygen #used to generate the keys 
enter 4 times
ssh-copy-id root@private-ip  -- > yes -- > password
ssh private-ip
ctrl d

NOTE: COPY THE KEYS TO ALL WORKER NODES BY USING ABOVE METHOD
